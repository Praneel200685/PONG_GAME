# PONG_GAME
This two-player Pong game uses Pythonâ€™s Turtle graphics. The left paddle is controlled with the W and S keys, and the right paddle with the Up and Down arrow keys. Players hit a moving ball back and forth, aiming to score points when the opponent misses. The game shows live scores and uses simple keyboard events for smooth paddle movement. The ball and paddles are turtle objects, and the game runs in a graphical window with basic animation and collision logic.
